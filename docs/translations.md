# Translations

keybr.com is available in several languages, such as English, German, Spanish, etc.
It is also constantly changing, we add new strings, update the existing ones.
We are unable to keep the quality of the translations on our own, without help from the contributors. So we are asking for your help to translate keybr.com into your language.

You can contribute as little as a small spelling fix, or as much as a complete website translation. Translating keybr.com does not require any programming skills. Everything is done in the simple and intuitive UI of a third party tool, [poeditor.com](https://poeditor.com/).

Start contributing by visiting [the translation project page](https://poeditor.com/join/project/MI55lGihyN). Create a contributor account, if you don't have one. Select an existing language, or suggest a new one. You will be presented with a table of strings to be translated. On the left you will see the original strings in English. On the right there will be your translations. Just fill in the text fields with your translations, that's it.

A few more tips.

Use [the filter field](https://poeditor.com/kb/how-to-filter-strings-localization-project) to quickly find the strings to be translated.

When an original English string changes it becomes [fuzzy](https://poeditor.com/kb/fuzzy-translations), and its translations need to be updated accordingly. It is a good idea to search for fuzzy strings.
